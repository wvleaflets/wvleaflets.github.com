Shared Distribution is a slightly cheaper alternative but then your leaflet is falling onto the doormat with up to 5 other leaflets. The reduced cost must surely be out weighed by the fact the householder picks up a bundle of leaflets and your marketing message is at best just one of many, it is possible that it may not even be seen if it is surrounded by others.
