title: What are the typical response rates?
---
Successful response to a leaflet depends on various factors such as the ‘effectiveness of the leaflet itself’, seasonal influences, the type of product or service you are marketing, whether your leaflet has been delivered on a solus leaflet distribution or shared leaflet distribution basis, the size of the market that you are trying to cater for, etc., so there are no 'typical' response rates. However, research by the Direct Marketing Association shows that:

* 62-71% of consumers find door drops useful.
* 48% have visited a store, bought a product or sent for information as a result of a door drop.
* 79% keep, pass on, read or glance at door drops.
